Car Price Prediction â€“ Linear Regression with Gradient Descent
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements a multivariate linear regression model from scratch using gradient descent to predict car prices based on various features such as make, fuel type, transmission, mileage, engine size, and vehicle age.
The model is trained and evaluated on a provided dataset, with preprocessing steps like feature encoding and standardization included.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset file used is:

ðŸš€ How to Run
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
Place Car_Price_Prediction.csv in the same directory as the script.

Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook cells in order.

ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaways
Implemented Linear Regression from scratch without using sklearn's built-in regression model.

Achieved high RÂ² scores on both training and testing sets, indicating good generalization.

Demonstrated feature encoding, scaling, and gradient descent optimization on a real dataset.
